# Social Media Statistics 📈📊🧐

Collect and analyze your social media data. Currently supported are:
- Spotify
- Youtube

I have kids and they like streaming services. So i started to analyze the data to see what they are watching to get an
idea of their screen time.

The data i analyzed is pretty interesting, so I decided to share the code with you. Maybe you can use it to analyze your own and your
children's data.
